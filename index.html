            <h2>Willow</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Hi, my name is Willow the Akita. My daddy adopted me 6 years ago from Southern Akita Rescue Alliance.
               My previous parents moved out of their home and had to leave me behind. I was alone tied to a tree for three days until SARA came and rescued me. Since being with my new Daddy, I have toys, cuddles, and all the peanut butter I can eat. It's not a bad life, but I wish I had a little sibling to play with.

            <h2>Bjorn</h2>
            <p class="funParagraph">Hi, my name is Bjorn the cat. My daddies adopted me 3 years ago from a local shelter. My daddies came in just to look at the cats. When we first met I was so tired and weak from my neutering surgery that I fell asleep in their arms. From the moment they held me, I knew I was safe and loved. When we got home, 
               I got to meet my new sister Willow. The medication from my surgery wore off and I felt much better. I then began to run around the house and climb all over my cat tree and my daddies.
